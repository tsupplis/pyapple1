Apple1 - Apple 1 Emulator
------------------------

Apple1 (Malum) is a simple Apple 1 emulator in Python.

It requires the py65.  It can either be on the system path or in the current directory.  It can be installed with the Python package manager pip or can be found at https://github.com/mnaberez/py65 and cloned with git.  For example: 

    % git clone https://github.com/mnaberez/py65.git py65.git
    % cp -a py65.git/py65 . 

At present, it emulates 
- an Apple 1 with 4 KB of RAM at 0 and the Woz monitor at 0xFF00, or 
- a Replica 1 with 32 KB of RAM, 8 KB of ROM including Integer BASIC at E000, Krusader assembler at F000 and the Woz monitor at FF00 or
- a Replica 1 with 32 KB of RAM, 8 KB of ROM including Applesoft BASIC at E000 (https://cowgod.org/replica1/applesoft/)

To run:

    python3 Apple1.py -m replica1

Control-E is reset, control-C exits.  \ is the Woz monitor reset prompt.  You can read more about the Woz monitor at http://sbprojects.com/projects/apple1/wozmon.php

\0x127 and Control-H emit an underscoer character

Example where the first 32 bytes of Integer Basic are first dumped, Integer BASIC is then run, a small BASIC program is entered and then executed.

    >LIST
       10 PRINT "HELLO"

    >RUN
    HELLO

Loading a binary:

    python3 Apple1.py -m replica1 -l test/hello.bin
    \
    280 R


will load a binary at address 0x280

(simple c/assembly development can be done using either https://github.com/tsupplis/cc65 which contains apple 1/replica 1 targets based on https://github.com/jefftranter/6502)

Todo:

* Load and save RAM (binary and ASCII wozmon format)
* non-hardcoded paths
* verify accuracy
* multiple models (4k Apple 1, 8K Apple 1, Replica-1, etc.)
